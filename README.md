The purpose of the dissertation was the study of the Software Development Frameworks. More extensively, an application had been developed, which depicted the information of a social network using a specific Software Development Framework, the NetBeans Platform. Components and tools were used, which were provided from the aforesaid platform, aiming to a full understanding of its advantages and facilitations. The same application had been developed without a framework, but it was based on the basic graphical library of the Java Programming Language. The structure and the specifications of a social network had also been synoptically studied. At the end, conclusions were exported and the two applications were getting compared, based on their development. Specifically, elements like ease of development and ease of communication between application components but also the size of each application, expressed in lines of code, were taken into consideration.
